### User accounts 
Accounts in Sigma Sky represents a real individual. As a user, you manage your own identity and credentials.  
- You can be invited to join one or more organizations, allowing you to act on behalf of those organizations. 
- Individual users may apply for free resources through open calls. However, purchasing resources requires affiliation with an organization. 

### Organizations
An organization represents a legal entity responsible for billing and management of projects including their cost, members and policies. 

### Projects
Projects are created under an organization and serve as the workspace where resources are provisioned and managed. Each project inherits the access control and billing policies of its parent organization. Projects may also include external collaborators who are granted limited access without being  members of the organization.

### Offerings & Resources
Offerings are listings that define the types of resources available to purchase in Sigma Sky. 
Resources are the services you buy, such as virtual machines or storage, created from available offerings.
